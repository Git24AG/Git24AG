    <h1>Platres 3on3 Basketball Tournament </h1>
    <p>
In light of the campaign against Breast Cancer, in collaboration with <span style="color: #CB5996; font-weight: bold;">Europa Donna Cyprus</span>, for the second year in a row, an all-day basketball celebration named Platres 3on3 Basketball Tournament is being organized. The event will take place on June 2, 2024, at the sports facilities of Upper Platres.

Firstly, we would like to inform you that this particular initiative is spearheaded by a small team of young volunteers who, with enthusiasm, unwavering zeal, and energy, embarked on a selfless effort to contribute in their own way to the ongoing fight championed by <span style="color: #CB5996; font-weight: bold;">Europa Donna Cyprus</span> over the years. The team's primary objective is to bring people together regardless of age, from any part of the island, providing them with the opportunity to compete or even witness a beautiful basketball spectacle, experiencing the unique atmosphere of this tournament amidst the idyllic landscape of Upper Platres.
Registration will be open from April 29th to May 29th, 2024.

The admission fee of Ð„40 covers registration for the Platres 3on3 Basketball Tournament, a double-faced basketball jersey, awards for the first-place winners of each division, and proceeds that will be donated to <span style="color: #CB5996; font-weight: bold;">Europa Donna Cyprus</span>.
